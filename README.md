A side project to sharpen my C++ skills.
I got the idea for this program based off of an example in a video my 3 blue 1 brown (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltLUadnCyi0)
one of the first examples he gives to explain the problem of finding the average shadow of a cube given a stationary scale and random orientation what is to do the exact same problem but with a flat plane instead.
I'm not smart enough yet to do the full problem and programmatically represented in C but I have managed to brute force an answer to the average area of a plane in the form of a percentage given random orientations.
